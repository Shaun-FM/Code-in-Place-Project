# Code-in-Place-Project
Project created as part of Stanford's CS106A Code in Place initiative
I am a retired IT professional.  I completed Stanford's CS106A Code in Place course.  I created a programme that featured many of the animation techniques we learned on the course.  This repository contains that programme.
